# Hybrid Optimization and Performance Platform

As part of NREL's [Hybrid Energy Systems Research](https://www.nrel.gov/wind/hybrid-energy-systems-research.html), this
software assesses optimal designs for the deployment of utility-scale hybrid energy plants, particularly considering wind,
solar and storage.

## Software requirements
- Python version 3.5+ 64-bit

## Install
HOPP is available as a PyPi package:

`pip install HOPP` 

## Examples

The examples can be run by installing HOPP, then cloning the repo and calling each example file.
